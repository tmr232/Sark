How To Contribute
=================

The Sark project was created to provide an intuitive, easy to use scripting
layer for IDA Pro. If something seems like the right-way to do something,
it should probably be added to Sark.

If you have something you think is worth adding, either submit a new issue
or (preferably) create a pull-request.

When contributing, try and follow these guidelines:

- Add yourself to the `AUTHORS.rst`_ file in alphabetical order. Every
  contribution shall be credited.
- Each new feature must have a reproducible test-case or usage. If it can't
  be used, it will not get in.
- Obey `PEP 8`_ and `PEP 257`_.
- All code should be documented. Usage samples and references to the IDASDK
  headers are a bonus.
- Write meaningful commit messages.
- No change is too small. You are welcome to fix typos, convention violations,
  or plain ugly code. All contributions are welcome.
- When submitting a fix to a bug, describe the bug being fixed. Include both
  the bug and the desired results. Creating an issue for the bug is good practice.
- When reporting bugs, make sure you mention your OS and IDA version.

If you can't adhere to the guidelines, **submit your pull requests anyway**.
Maybe someone else can improve on it.
